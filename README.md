## Abtract
Aim: To identify different risk factors for history or activity of early childhood caries(ECC).

## Methods
Cross-sectional study. 291 children aged 2 to 5 years from Panguipulli, Chile, were examined using Nyvad’s activity criteria[Nyvad et al: Caries Res 1999;33:252–260] by four clinicians (kappa intra/inter > .7). Categories 1-3 were recorded as active caries lesions and 4-6 as history of caries. Dependent variable was categorized into four mutually exclusive groups according to caries history or activity: no history-no activitiy [NoH_NoA]; activity only [NoH_YesA]; history only (YesH_NoA); or both [YesH_YesA]. Sample size was estimated to detect 15 different risk factors. Parents completed a questionnaire to assess possible risks factors. A multinomial logistic regression was done to detect differences in risk factors for groups (NoH_NoA, NoH_YesA, YesH_NoA, YesH_YesA). Reference level was NoH_NoA. Significance was set at p=0.05. Analysis were performed using R.

## Results
The proportion of children with no caries history or activity was 34.7%, with history only 33.0%, with active caries only 7.9%, and with both 24.4%. Exclusive risk factor for activity of ECC was presence of visible plaque(p=0.041). Risk factors for both history and activity were bedtime-bottle(p=0.03), sugary-drinks(p=0.03), lack of dental check-ups (p=0.018) and lack of vegetable-patch at home(p=0.024).

## Conclusions
There are different risk factors that explain early childhood caries history, activity (plaque) or both (night-bottle, sugary-drinks, lack of dental control and lack of vegetable-patch).

## Summary
**There are different risk factors that explain early childhood caries history, activity (plaque) or both (night-bottle, sugary-drinks, lack of dental control and lack of vegetable-patch).**
